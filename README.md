# Reading notes for codefellows
this is my readding note
## About myself
Hey there I'm Veronika. Ukrainian immigrant with bachelor degree in "environmental protection" who decided to became Web developer. Been a housewife for awhile now, due to that I got myself into arts and crafts, love to paint and play music instruments. I started to code about 4 months ago and felt like its a fun and challenging thing to do. So me and my 64-bit OS are going to conquer the World one day)))
### Growth Mindset
 To me growth midset is:
 - Views failure as an opportunity to learn.
 - Believes failures are just temporary setbacks.
 - Embraces challenges.


My name is Veronika and like:
==========================
 1. Food
 1. Sleep
 1. Play


***Therefore I'm a cat***
