## How to make your Wireframe Good: 3 Key Principles
1. Clarity - Your wireframe is an aid for you to visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the userâ€™s most important questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.
2.  Confidence - Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand. If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places user confidence diminishes. A lot of this information can already be organized at the wireframing stage. 
3. Simplicity is key - Your wireframe should be a visual guide to the framework of your site and how it will be navigated.
