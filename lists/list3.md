Bitwise AND	a & b	Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are ones

Bitwise OR	a | b	Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are zeros.

Bitwise XOR	a ^ b	Returns a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits are the same.

[Returns a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits are different.]

Bitwise NOT	~ a	Inverts the bits of its operand.
Left shift	a << b	Shifts a in binary 

representation b bits to the left, shifting in zeros from the right.

Sign-propagating right shift	a >> b	Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off.

Zero-fill right shift	a >>> b	Shifts a in binary representation b bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off, and shifting in zeros from the left.
